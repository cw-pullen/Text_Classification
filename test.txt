This is test data. It is mostly empty. This data is writen by a human. It will be used in to test a classifier that takes in a text file and outputs its expected source, human or robot. This file should be of decent length so that the classifier gets closer to its input size of 250 words. While the file does not need to be exaclty 200 words, it should be close. This file is now deemed satisfactory at this length.
